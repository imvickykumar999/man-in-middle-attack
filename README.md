Here is an example of how a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack could be simulated in Python. This is for educational purposes only to demonstrate how vulnerabilities can be exploited. It is illegal and unethical to use this knowledge to perform unauthorized attacks.

This example sets up a basic MITM attack using socket programming, where the attacker intercepts communication between a client and a server.

### How to run this:

1. Run the MITM attacker: `python mitm.py`
2. Run the server: `python server.py`
3. Run the client: `python client.py`

The MITM attacker intercepts and logs the data exchanged between the client and the server.

### Explanation:
- The client sends a message to the server through the MITM proxy.
- The MITM proxy logs the message and forwards it to the server.
- The server sends a response back through the MITM proxy.
- The MITM proxy logs the response and forwards it to the client.

This setup shows how an attacker can intercept and log communication between a client and a server, emphasizing the importance of using encrypted connections (e.g., TLS/SSL) to protect data.
